/**
 * The roster half's configuration: the one knob the composer control edits.
 *
 * Research width — how many questions a round researches — is a per-call
 * argument the model chooses, and that is the right default: the model has just
 * read the topic and knows how broad it needs to go. What it does not know is
 * the deployment. Hence a PIN: the model picks width from the topic, the
 * operator picks it from the box, and the operator wins.
 *
 * Width is NOT the concurrency control, and pinning it is not how an
 * over-capacity fan-out is kept alive. A round is handed to the runtime whole
 * and @creait/dsh-gen-limit holds the researchers in a FIFO queue against the
 * backend's real limit, so what runs at once is a deployment-wide setting this
 * plugin does not own. Clamping width down to it would simply research fewer
 * questions and report the rest as never answered — the failure it looks like
 * it prevents. Width buys breadth; concurrency buys time.
 *
 * `width: 0` means "auto" — the model's argument stands, then the preset row's
 * `width`. Any value >= 1 is the user saying they want that width whatever the
 * model asks for, clamped to the preset row's `maxWidth` like any other width.
 *
 * NOTE on the names: this key is `width` on the ROSTER row (the pin, 0 = auto)
 * and `width` again on the TOOL row inside the preset (the per-call default, 4).
 * They are different settings in different files.
 *
 * Since dsh 0.2 the settings service keys forms by PROFILE ENTRY ID rather than
 * by a plugin-registered namespace, so the pin is addressed by the roster row's
 * id ({@link RESEARCH_ENTRY_ID}) and `width` is declared `.volatile()` for the
 * form to project it. The browser control still speaks its own route segment
 * ({@link RESEARCH_SETTINGS_NAMESPACE}) — that name is part of the wire payload
 * and of the stored override's history, so it did not move with the key.
 *
 * The row is registered by the roster half (host plane, where `settings` and
 * `webServer` live) and READ by the tool half (agent plane, inside the preset's
 * realm). They share this module and nothing else — no service, no injection —
 * which keeps the roster half's "registers nothing" claim intact.
 *
 * @module @creait/dsh-research-mode/config
