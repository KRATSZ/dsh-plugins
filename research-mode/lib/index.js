/**
 * @creait/dsh-research-mode — deep research as an agent mode.
 *
 * Research that is worth the name is a fan-out: a topic decomposed into
 * independent questions, each chased by its own agent, the findings reconciled
 * and then argued with before anyone reads them. dsh has every piece of that — a
 * workflow engine, a subagent seam, web search, and (with a fetch provider
 * mounted) page reading. What it does not have is the loop, and a loop the model
 * writes fresh on each call re-earns the same structural mistakes each time:
 * work dropped when a budget runs out, the same gap chased three rounds running,
 * a report that reads as complete because nobody counted what was never looked
 * at. So the loop ships here as a fixed, reviewed script and the model supplies
 * parameters to it.
 *
 * What that loop should NOT be is a permanent tool definition and a paragraph of
 * guidance in the context of every session that has nothing to do with research.
 * dsh already resolves that: an agent preset is a composition, and a tool absent
 * from the composition does not exist for that agent. So this package ships two
 * plugin entry points and mounts on two planes.
 *
 *   ROSTER PLANE — this module, mounted by the profile bundle.
 *     Declares this plugin's settings page policy and serves the loopback route
 *     its composer control reads and writes. What it does NOT register is
 *     anything the model can see: no tool, no prompt section, no command, no
 *     injected service. A session on another mode gets the same system prompt and
 *     the same tool catalog it got before this package was installed — that is
 *     the claim this design has to earn, and the one worth verifying after
 *     install. The width control is browser chrome and gates itself on the
 *     session's preset, so it costs those sessions a settings form nobody reads
 *     and nothing else.
 *
 *   AGENT PLANE — `@creait/dsh-research-mode/tool`, mounted by the row inside
 *     `presets/research.patch.yml`. Registers `deep_research`, and only sessions
 *     that chose the mode pay for it.
 *
 * They are separate entry points rather than one module behind a config flag
 * because the halves need different service dependencies and `inject` is a
 * module-level declaration that gates loading. The agent half must inject
 * `workflowEngine`, which on the web surface is provided per-preset; a roster row
 * declaring it would wait forever for a service this composition never
 * publishes.
 *
 * Since dsh 0.2 the preset is a declaration row in this bundle's patch rather
 * than a directory under `<dsh home>/.agent-presets` — the harness no longer
 * reads that directory. See `presets/research.patch.yml`.
 *
 * The loop's design — planner, adaptive rounds driven by the researchers' own
 * declared gaps, synthesis, adversarial review — is ported from
 * `dsh-deep-research` by omdsh-dev (MIT), which got the structure right. See
 * `./script.js` for what was changed and why.
