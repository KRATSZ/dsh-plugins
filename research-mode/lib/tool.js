/**
 * The model-facing surface: the `deep_research` tool.
 *
 * The tool takes a topic and returns a report. What it does NOT take is the
 * orchestration — the agent does not write the loop, does not choose the fan-out
 * shape, and cannot skip the review stage by forgetting it exists. dsh already
 * ships a `workflow` tool for model-authored orchestration, and that is the
 * right seam for one-off fan-out; it is the wrong seam for research, because a
 * research script rewritten from scratch on every call re-earns the same
 * structural mistakes every call. Here the script is a fixed asset
 * (`./script.js`), reviewed once, and the model supplies parameters to it.
 *
 * This module is the AGENT-PLANE entry point: `@creait/dsh-research-mode/tool`,
 * mounted by the row inside `presets/research/agent.cordis.yml`. In every other
 * session it is never imported, the tool is never registered, and none of the
 * text below is in the context window.
 *
 * Its `workflowEngine` dependency is why this is a separate plugin from the
 * roster half. On the web surface the host plane disables the engine and each
 * preset mounts its own inside a realm, so this row has to sit in that realm —
 * see the preset — and the roster half must not declare the dependency at all.
 *
 * @module @creait/dsh-research-mode/tool

const DESCRIPTION =
	'Run a full multi-agent research pass on a topic and return a cited report. The topic is planned into independent sub-questions, each researched by its own agent with web search and page fetching, in adaptive rounds — high-priority gaps found in one round become the next round\'s questions — then synthesised into a report and checked against its own evidence for fabricated citations and overclaiming. Use it when the answer needs several independent lines of enquiry, current sources, or a written deliverable someone else will read. Do NOT use it for a single lookup: one fact, one definition, one current value, or anything a couple of web_search calls settle — this spawns many agents and takes minutes, and on a simple question it is strictly worse than searching yourself. The result carries its own coverage accounting: how many planned questions were actually researched, and which were never answered because the round budget ran out or a researcher failed. Those unanswered questions are real holes in the report — relay them to the user rather than presenting the report as complete coverage of the topic.';
